    Read me file for the RL78 Flash Data Library T04
===============================================================================

The Flash Data Library T04 (Pico) offers the user an easy to use interface to
directly access the data flash. This library aims at a reduced feature set in
order to enable Data-Flash access on small devices. Hence, there is no EEPROM
emulation library available from Renesas which operates on the Flash Data
Library T04. Please refer to the documentation for a detailed description.

The following features are supported by the Flash Data Library T04:

Configurable size of user and EEL pool size:                NO
Access authority check (user pool and EEL pool):            NO
Access size (read, write, blank-check, verify):             1 to 1024 bytes
Access size (erase):                                        1 block (1024 bytes)
Operating modes:                                            Polling
Request/Response-oriented dialog:                           NO
Standby/wakeup feature:                                     NO
Automatic suspend/resume of block-oriented commands:        NO
Automatic priority control for user access:                 NO
Automatic priority control for block- and
                               byte/word-oriented commands: NO
"Read at any time" capability:                              NO
Secure open/close synchronization between FDL and EEL:      NO
EEL support:                                                NO

Please note that in addition to the Flash Data Library T04 there are other
Flash Data Libraries available from Renesas with different feature sets and
resource consumptions.

The following libraries are also provided for download:

- RL78 Flash Data Library T01        (Installer: RENESAS_RL78_EEL-FDL_T01_PACK01_xVxx)
- RL78 Flash Data Library T02 (Tiny) (Installer: RENESAS_RL78_EEL-FDL_T02_PACK02_xVxx)

Installer Changes
-----------------
    V2.00
    -----
    - Change to new installer
    - Difference information of related documents
      Please replace the following descriptions on target related documents.
      with the "Library" part  of "3. File Naming".
       - User Manual: Data Flash Access Library T04 (Pico)
         Document #: R01US0055ED0112
         Difference: Cover   Installer name
                     Page 17-18 "2.2.1 File Structure"
       - Differences Manual:
                Data Flash Access Library Type T04(Pico), European Release
                Differences between the IAR compiler V2.xx version and the 
                CC-RL compiler version
         Document #: R20UT3540EJ0101
         Difference: Page 5 "3.2 File Structure for IAR V2.xx tool chain"
    - New installer 's version is V3.00 because Installer version  V2.xx 
      already been used by Asia region package reason why the naming rule 
      for Asia region package  was differ from European region.

How to integrate
----------------
    1) copy all the files into your project subdirectory
    2) add all pfdl*.* files into your project (workbench or make-file)
    3) adapt the sample linker file to your requirements
       --> at least the segment PFDL_COD should be defined
    4) re-compile the project
