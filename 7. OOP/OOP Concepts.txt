Key OOP concepts:

Encapsulation: Binding code and data together in an object. Keeps details private and exposes selected information.  

Inheritance: Child classes inherit properties and behaviors from parent classes. Allows code reuse.

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details, exposing only essential features. Achieved via abstract classes and interfaces.

Polymorphism: Entities can take different forms. Method overriding allows subclasses to override parent methods. Method overloading provides same method name with different parameters.

In summary:

- Encapsulation bundles code and data in objects, hiding implementation details
- Inheritance enables code reuse through parent-child class relationships
- Abstraction focuses on essential features by hiding complexity
- Polymorphism allows objects to exhibit different forms and behaviors

These core OOP principles enable modular and reusable code through interfaces, inheritance, and object composition. They provide flexibility while managing complexity.
