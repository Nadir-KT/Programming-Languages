  1.Diff between c and c++ ?
 ans: 


    c                                                         c++


 1.c is a procedual language .                           1. c++ is obeject oriented language.

 2.c is used functions                                   2.c++ is used object and class

 3.In C data and functions are                           3.In C++ data and functions are encapsulated 
     separate and free entities.                                 together in form of an object.

 4. In c data is not sequred                             4.data is hidden (sequred)

 5.c have 32 keywords                                    5. in c++ more then 40 kwywords used

 6.The header file is #include<stdio.h>                  6. here #include<iostream> is used
 
 7.prinf and scanf are used to                           7.cout and cin are used to find ouputs  
     find the ouputs.
 
 8.C does not support reference variables.               8.C++ supports reference variables.

 9. c does not used reference variable                   9. it is used reference variable 

10.C provides malloc() and calloc() functions             10. C++ provides new operator for memory allocation and 
    for dynamic memory allocation, and free()                 delete operator for memory de-allocation.
     for memory de-allocation.
 
11.C has no support for virtual and friend functions.    11.C++ supports virtual and friend functions.
                    

12.it has no support for polymorphism, encapsulation.    12.C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.
     and inheritance.               






2. what is inline function and its uses?

ans: An inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is invoked. That is the complier replaces the function call with the corresponding function code.

   uses: it is used for faster exicution means exicution time is less
